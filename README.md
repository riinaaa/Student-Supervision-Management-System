# Student-Supervision-Management-System
As a college student, the student needs to add their subjects. In order to add their
subjects,
they may face problems and will have to communicate with their academic advisor to solve
the problem of adding courses. The common way to communicate with an academic
advisor is via the university email. But the student needs to send their information and the
request to add the course in the text of the message.
This method is good, but it takes time. furthermore, it is better to find a better option
for faciliting the communication process between the advisor and the student

-----PROBLEM------
students find difficulties in communicating with their advisors in order to discuss about
adding courses .
and in order to facilitate the communication process, we have developed a system that
facilitates the communication. Hence, the student can
further request adding courses easily and the academic advisor can find the target
studentâ€™s information faster all in one place.

-----SOLUTION------
we have developed this system to help facilities the communication between the
advisor and the student using advanced java programming concepts
(networking) & (multithreading) as well as storing the student and the advisor's info
in the database to retrieve the info easily with printing schedule's info in a file . the
advisor can easily add students under their supervision, update student's info and
delete students under their supervision.
